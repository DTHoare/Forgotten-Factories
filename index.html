<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
<p>Generations ago, the Empire deserted our island nation, leaving us stranded here with no way to reach the continent.
  They took all their riches with them, and the life we knew disappeared before us. Without any way to ask for help, or to know
  why they left, we were able to rebuild our own society.

<p>However, they did leave something behind for us: the grand factories. But the Empire had not trained us in all their ways,
  and the once wonderful factories that supplied our ancestors with lives of luxury, just decorate the landscape.

<p>Of course, you know this already young scholar. With your days of being tutored behind you, it is now time to take your final
  test. You must venture forth and enter into one of the grand factories. The factories are dangerous places, which work in ways
  none amongst us understand and hide a great many secrets. But if you are to join us as a full member, you must bring back some
  secret, a new artefact from the days of plenty and joy.

<p>Good luck.
